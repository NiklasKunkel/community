## [Executive Vote] Activate the USDC PSM, Reduce Stablecoin Debt Ceilings - December 18, 2020

The Governance Facilitator(s) have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system on behalf of the Maker Governance community. MKR Holders should vote for this proposal if they wish to make the following alterations to the Maker Protocol.

### Activate the USDC Peg Stability Module (PSM)

As per this governance [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmfTU85J?network=mainnet#poll-detail), the USDC PSM will be added to the Maker Protocol with the parameters given below if this proposal passes.

* The USDC PSM will be onboarded as the PSM-USDC-A vault type.
* The `tin` parameter will be set to 1% initially and will decrease to 0.1% over 7 days. `tin` refers to the fee when trading USDC in exchange for DAI.
* The `tout` parameter will be set to 0.1%. `tout` refers to the fee when trading DAI in exchange for USDC.
* The initial debt ceiling of the USDC PSM will equal 500 million DAI.

### Reduce Stablecoin Debt Ceilings

As per the same governance [poll](https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmfTU85J?network=mainnet#poll-detail), the USDC-A, TUSD-A, PAXUSD-A, and GUSD-A debt ceilings will be reduced to zero if this proposal passes.

* [Maker Foundation Statement on the PSM](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/foundation-statement-on-the-psm/5521)

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:
* The PSM-USDC-A vault type will be added using USDC as collateral with the parameters listed above.
* USDC-A Debt Ceiling will decrease from 485M to 0M
* TUSD-A Debt Ceiling will decrease from 135M to 0M
* PAXUSD-A Debt Ceiling will decrease from 100M to 0M
* GUSD-A Debt Ceiling will decrease 5M to 0M
* The global line parameter will decrease by 225M due to the debt ceiling changes.

This [Executive Vote](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will continue until the number of votes in favor surpasses the votes in favor of the currently leading proposal. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works) vote. 

If this executive vote does not pass within 30 days then it will no longer have any effect on the Maker Protocol, even if it should later pass. 

Note that this proposal will include an office-hours modifier that means it can only be cast between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday. This is to ensure that smart contracts engineers are on-standby at the time of activation to react to any unforeseen issues.

## Review

Community debate on these topics can be found on the MakerDAO [governance forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/). Please review any linked threads to inform your position before voting.
